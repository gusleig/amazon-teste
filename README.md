# Amazon Availability and Price Checker

This script helps checking if an Amazon product ID is available.

Just fill the product ID and price value (if value = 0 then no price check) in the products.csv file.

For Email alerts, fill the config.ini file with your configuration.

```
[EMAIL]
email_admin = gus@gmail.com
smtp_host = smtp.com
smtp_user = user
smtp_pass = pass
smtp_port = 587
smtp_from = no-reply@email.com
```
